# TerminalClient
A terminal client for PearHarmony peer to peer chat.

## Development
Unlike the other clinets for PearHarmony, the TerminalClient is developed in Intelij.
Also unlike the other client Maven is used as the build system to make the handling of the
nassasary libary easy. The GUI in the TerminalClient is created using the java lib [lanterna](https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna).
